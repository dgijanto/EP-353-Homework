# Status Report

## Current Status
At this point I have generally implemented a few different distortion types in pyo, getting the sound through a sine generator built into the program, and selecting the distortion type through a text input. I'm currently seeing how ambitious I want to get into the math, but I think as it stands, both my understanding of DFT, FFT, and time constraints limit me to some basic formula. I think I am fine with this, as I will be pivoting my studies in the next few semesters to nearly exclusively DSP coding and that sort of thing, so this is a really nice project to build upon as my math and DSP knowladge increase. Now that I have the equations generally implemented, I know I can transfer this over to a C based program pretty easily, which is a nice place to be close to deadline. I will likely code this up in C/C++ before going into JUCE, just so I can have the equations properly laid out before making the big leap into JUCE world. I'm fairly happy with where I sit, and depending on time will possibly get this implemented in JUCE, but I think I might make that a Winter Break project, just so I can spent appropriate time on my other classes as well. I think having all the code and maths down at this point is a really nice place to be after one semester of coding.
